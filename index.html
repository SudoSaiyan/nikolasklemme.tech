        <h3>System Administration</h3>
        <p>When I built my first computer at the age of 10, I kickstarted a lifelong drive for understanding and managing what goes on under the hood of technology. I was always the on-call tech support for my family and found myself naturally gravitating towards the tech industry as I got older. Most recently I've worked as a Linux System Administrator for <a href="http://www.maritz.com">Maritz</a>, a large marketing services company, and I am looking to continue to grow my knowledge of RHEL based systems.</p>

        <h3>Team Leadership and Communication</h3>
        <p>Throughout my career I have been looked upon to help guide and organize my peers, from detailing out processes and training new hires to taking an active role in directing parts of the organization. As a service desk representative, I quickly took on supervisory responsibilities which led to my promotion to a Level II position where I was in charge of keeping the quality of the service desk at the expected high level and was the last line in the escalation process.</p>

        <h3>Customer Service</h3>
        <p>I understand and appreciate how important it is that a business focuses on customer appreciation of their product. In tech, this translates to listening and understanding the business needs of the end users in order to build them a solution which allows them to do their job better instead of trying to hand them what you think they need. This approach has helped me with building client relations, personal branding, and most importantly—delivering excellent service to those I support.</p>

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>While originally stemming from my love of Greek mythology and writing, philosophical discussion and debate has grown to be an important part of my life these days. I find myself consistently looking for nuanced and deeper explanations of complex philosophical issues through books, audio, and video sources, as well as engaging my friends and family with thought experiments from time to time.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music has been very important to me from a young age, and before I was in high school, I had already been playing the saxophone and drums for years. Nowadays, I have a budding vinyl collection and I teach myself guitar and enjoy a healthy dose of karaoke when I can. I have also played drums in a few bands over the years, one of them is even  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4lAkS3H2ZorHA1jZd8UDW9?si=DwIPgpM2QQq0DWugefhmHA">streaming online now!</a></p>

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>Though not a master by any means, I joined the chess club in elementary school and have found fun in casually playing against friends and family as well as against competitors online. <a href="https://lichess.org/@/SudoSaiyan">Come play a round with me</a> if you would like!</p>
